# EverReader

EverReader is a web application which enables you to read long-form content stored in your Evernote account.  You can pick up where you left off, and use extra bookmarks to make long documents easier to navigate.

## Get started

At the moment, there is no public hosted version of EverReader available.  To run EverReader, you will need to:

1. Download the code
2. Get a developer API
3. Ask for the developer key to be activated on the production server (so you can access your actual notes)
4. Use Visual Studio 2015 to run the web application.

A hosted version will hopefully be rolled out in due course.  

## Architecture

EverReader runs on ASP.NET 5 (developed using beta8) and is written in `C#` and `Javascript`.
