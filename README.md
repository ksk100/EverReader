# EverReader

EverReader is a web application which enables you to read long-form content stored in your Evernote account.  You can pick up where you left off, and use extra bookmarks to make long documents easier to navigate.

## Get started

A hosted version runs at [http://everreader.azurewebsites.net](http://everreader.azurewebsites.net).  This is currently private beta, but you can request access by sending me an email. 

Alternatively, you can run EverReader yourself.  You will need to:

1. Download the code
2. Get a developer API
3. Ask for the developer key to be activated on the production server (so you can access your actual notes)
4. Use Visual Studio 2015 to run the web application.

## Architecture

EverReader runs on `ASP.NET 5` (developed using `beta8`) and uses `jQuery`, `knockout.js` and `bootstrap`.  It is written in `C#` and `Javascript`.
